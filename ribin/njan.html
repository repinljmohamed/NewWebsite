        <p style="text-align: center;"> There are a couple of things to do next while you re gelling sel up:

            <p style="text-align: center;"> If you've got a publication that you don't want the world to see yet because it's not ready to launch, 
                you can hide your Ghost site behind a basic shared pass- phrase. You can toggle this preference on at the 
                hottom of Chast's General Settings:

                Ghost will give you a short, randomly generated pass pfcase which you can
                
                share with anyone who needs access to the site while you're working on it
                
                While this setting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be
                
                swelched off to help keep your site under the race.
                
                Do remember though, this is not secure authentication. You shouldn't rely on
                
                this feature for protecting important private data. It's just a simple, shared pass-phrase for some very basic privacy.

                <p style="text-align: center;"> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
                    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typeselling 
                    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the relcase of 
                    Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
                    software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem ipsum</p>
